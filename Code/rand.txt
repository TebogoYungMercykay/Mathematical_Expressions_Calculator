– term(input: const char*)
    - This is a parameterized constructor.
    - The passed-in parameter is a c-string. This should be converted to a string for ease of use.
    - The passed-in string will be used to initialize the term.
    - The coefficient may be positive or negative.
    - If the coefficient is ±1, the 1 may be written or omitted. The + sign can also be written out or omitted.
    - After the coefficient, there will be a *. This represents multiplication. Note that it is possible for the variables to start immediately, in this case, the coefficient is 1.
    - There will be no spaces in the passed-in string.
    - Every variable will be separated using a *.
    - If the power of a variable is 1, then the exponent may be written out or omitted.
    - If a variable has a power, it will be indicated by ˆ. The number after the caret is the power.
    - The order of the variables can be in any order, but this should be sorted when storing the variables.
    - It is also possible for variables to be repeated. In this case, the powers should be added.
    - Remember to use the functions you already coded.
    - See Figure 2 for examples.


– removeVariable(var: char): void
    - This function will attempt to remove a variable from the term.
    - If the passed-in variable is within the term, then remove that variable from the variables array. Remember to also remove the corresponding power. Make sure that the variables array stays sorted and that there are no gaps.

– addVariable(var: char, pow: int): void
    - Please note, in a mathematical sense this should actually be seen as multiplication, but programming-wise, you are adding the variable to the array.
    - This function will attempt to add a variable to the term.
    - If the term’s coefficient is 0, then no variables should be added.
    - If the passed-in power is negative or 0, then don’t add this variable.
    - If the passed-in variable is already in the term, then increase the power of the variable by the passed-in amount. For example: If the term is 2x^2, and you call this function with parameters var = x, pow = 3, then the term should change to 2x^5.
    - If the passed-in variable is not already in the term, then the passed-in parameters should be added to the corresponding arrays. Make sure that the variables array stays sorted.
